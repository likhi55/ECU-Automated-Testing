# SCR000001 - Ignition Control

## Summary
Turn on the engine when the ignition switch is ON; turn it off when ignition switch is OFF.

## Functionality / Requirements
- Engine state should reflect ignition switch position:
  - ignition_switch = 1 → engine_state = 1 (running)
  - ignition_switch = 0 → engine_state = 0 (stopped)
- No other logic impacts engine_state in this SCR.
- Must be implemented in `app/c_files/engine.c`.

## Inputs / Signals
- `ignition_switch` (calibration / input file, values: 0 or 1)

## Outputs
- `engine_state` (0 or 1)

## Calibration
- ignition_switch (1 for ON, 0 for OFF) → read from calibration file

## Test Coverage & Impact
- Testcases to verify:
  - Ignition ON → engine starts
  - Ignition OFF → engine stops
  - Rapid toggle → engine follows switch state
- No regression expected; base ECU logic.
